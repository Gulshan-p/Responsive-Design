This all starts with our thorough, gentle, and integrative approach to dental exams and cleanings.

We never judge. Even if it’s been years since your last cleaning or exam, you’ll leave our office feeling confident about what the future holds for your teeth and gums. We don’t lecture patients about needing to floss more. In fact, that’s the opposite of integrative care. We will evaluate what you’re doing right and point out areas where you can improve. Remember, flossing isn’t the only answer. In our integrative office, we believe alternative treatments might be what works for you. </P>
